    "Also, notice how there are border effects to the left and right of the charts when we use `Quantized(...)` as a distribution wrapper to round the numbers. Those weird border effect wouldn't appear if you'd limit the distribution to half numbers instead of plain number. Let's say you have a `Quantized(Uniform(-10, 10))`: then the samples from approximately -9.5 to -8.5 are rounded to the bin of the number -9, but the values from -10 to -9.5 are rounder to the bin -10 and a half is missing, so the -10 bin sees its values sampled half as often as -9. That explains the border effect, and you could fix it easily by taking the uniform range from -10.49999 to 10.49999."

You could instead use the PriorityChoice which would remove each options by keeping the ones at the beginning of the list, and also bringing back to the beginning the best guess every time. Let's look at a concrete example below. "
